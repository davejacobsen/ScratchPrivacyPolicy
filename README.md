## Information Collection and Use  

- While using our Service, the app does not require you to provide personally identifiable or contact information such as your name, email, or location.

- Operating system version  
- The time and date of your use of the Service

This information is collected for troubleshooting, app improvement, and performance monitoring only.

I have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I will immediately delete it from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and you become aware that your child has provided such information, please contact me so that I can take the necessary actions.
